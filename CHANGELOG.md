# Changelog

The purpose of this file is to record all changes to the scaffold app, including minor version updates, pull requests, and releases/tags.

## Relationship between CHANGELOG.md PROMPTLOG.md files
PROMPTLOG.md contains useful AI agent prompts to fix and enhance the scaffold app. The prompts will include some used during changes logged below. Remember that AI agent prompts aren't exact, and you should use them as a template for your own purposes, rather than as-is. Re-running prompts is not guaranteed to provide the same results.
