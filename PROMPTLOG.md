# Promptlog

## Relationship between CHANGELOG.md PROMPTLOG.md files
This PROMPTLOG.md contains useful AI agent prompts to fix and enhance the scaffold app. The prompts will include some used during changes logged in the CHANGELOG.md file. Remember that AI agent prompts aren't exact, and you should use them as a template for your own purposes, rather than as-is. Re-running prompts is not guaranteed to provide the same results.
