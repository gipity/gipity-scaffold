# Contributing to Gipity Scaffold

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

For the initial stages of this project, I’m focusing on building and refining the first few versions of the scaffold app myself. This helps ensure the architecture and approach are consistent before opening up wider collaboration.

## Current Contribution Policy

- **Pull Requests:**  
  At this time, I’m unlikely to accept PRs directly into the repo. This is just so I can keep early development focused and cohesive.  
  If you have an idea or spot an issue, please start a discussion first (see below).

- **Discussions:**  
  GitHub Discussions are enabled — and I’m very happy for you to post:
  - Ideas for enhancements
  - Bug reports
  - Suggestions for improvements
  - Questions about the code

- **Future Contributions:**  
  Once the early versions are stable, I’ll review how best to open up the repo for PRs. At that point, I’ll document coding style, branch workflows, and review process here.

## How to Share Ideas

Please use the **Discussions** tab on GitHub:
- Start a new topic for your idea or feedback
- Include as much detail as possible (screenshots, examples, reasoning)
- Be constructive and respectful

Thanks for your interest in Gipity Scaffold — I really value your input, even if we’re not merging code just yet.
